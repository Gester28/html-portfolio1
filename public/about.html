<h1>Hello, I'm Gester.</h1>
<p>I work as an IT Specialist.</p>
<p>
  My venture into the realm of IT commenced during my high school years. 
  With guidance from my uncle, I secured a part-time job where I learned computer repair skills,
  earning money to aid my family and support my education. Despite financial constraints preventing
  me from pursuing an IT degree in the Philippines, I opted for a Bachelor of Industrial Technology
  with a focus on Electronics, the only affordable option available. Juggling studies with my ongoing
  role as a computer technician was challenging, but I successfully completed the program.

    Upon graduation, I joined a prominent retail group, SM Supermarket, as a Technical Assistant,
   specializing in Point of Sales (POS) support and computer and printer repair. 
   However, due to financial obligations, I transitioned to a CCTV Administrator 
   position to better support my family. This role provided deeper insights into the IT industry.

<p>
  Presently, I serve as an IT Specialist at a renowned Animation Company, 
  where I am committed to realizing my dream of becoming a Web Developer.
   I am currently enrolled in Web Development courses to further hone my skills in this area.
  My dedication to becoming a proficient Web Developer stems from a genuine passion for
   the field and a desire to prioritize my family's well-being by providing financial stability.
</p>

<p>My guiding principle is to transform adverse circumstances into positive opportunities. </p>
